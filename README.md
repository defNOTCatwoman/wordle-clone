# Wordle Clone

A clone of the popular game Wordle with similar functionality. You have six attempts
to guess the word chosen at random from the word list. 

Wordle makes a check to see if the word you entered is contained on the list then displays
the letters, if any, are present in the random word. Yellow means the letters are contained but in the wrong placement. Green means you got the letter and placement correct.

Made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
